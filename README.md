# Integration_window

# This program displays a rotating stimulus (a circle with 8 disks attached to it), which changes sense of rotation at 800 ms after rotation has started.
# The goal of the experiment is to study windows of temporal integration.
# After a certain variable duration, comprised between 730 and 870ms after rotation has begun, one of the disks in the rotating circle is not displayed fully, but as a succession of one half disk + the other half.

# First independent variable: presentation time of the half-disks vary.
# Second independent variable: relative time of the integration stimulus to the change in axis of rotation.
